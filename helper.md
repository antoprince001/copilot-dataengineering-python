1. Time-Based Segmentation:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import when, col

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("EcommerceAnalysis").getOrCreate()

# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'ecommerce_data'
# Create a new column to categorize shipping speed
ecommerce_data = ecommerce_data.withColumn("Shipping_Speed",
    when(col("Aging") < 2, "Express")
    .when((col("Aging") >= 2) & (col("Aging") <= 7), "Standard")
    .otherwise("Delayed")
)

# Group by 'Shipping_Speed' and analyze product category distribution
product_category_distribution = ecommerce_data.groupBy("Shipping_Speed", "Product_Category").count()

# Identify product categories prone to delays and suggest strategies
delayed_categories = product_category_distribution.filter(col("Shipping_Speed") == "Delayed")
# Analyze and provide suggestions for delayed categories
2. Customer Segmentation and Profitability:

python
Copy code
# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'ecommerce_data'
# Create a new column to categorize customers based on sales and profit
ecommerce_data = ecommerce_data.withColumn("Customer_Segment",
    when((col("Sales") > 1000) & (col("Profit") > 100), "High-Value")
    .when((col("Sales") > 100) & (col("Profit") > 10), "Medium-Value")
    .otherwise("Low-Value")
)

# Group by 'Customer_Segment' and analyze product preferences and order priorities
product_preferences = ecommerce_data.groupBy("Customer_Segment", "Product_Category").count()
order_priorities = ecommerce_data.groupBy("Customer_Segment", "Order_Priority").count()

# Provide insights on tailoring offerings for different customer segments
# Analyze the product preferences and order priorities within each segment
3. Sequential Discount Analysis:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, lag, coalesce

# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'ecommerce_data'
# Sort the DataFrame by 'Customer_id' and 'Order_Date'
window_spec = Window.partitionBy("Customer_id").orderBy("Order_Date")

# Calculate cumulative discount for each customer's order sequence
ecommerce_data = ecommerce_data.withColumn("Cumulative_Discount",
    sum(col("Discount")).over(window_spec)
)

# Analyze the relationship between cumulative discounts and customer loyalty
# Consider factors such as order frequency and average order value
4. Dynamic Shipping Cost Analysis:

python
Copy code
# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'ecommerce_data'
# Create a UDF (User-Defined Function) to calculate dynamic shipping cost
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
from pyspark.sql.types import DoubleType

def calculate_dynamic_shipping_cost(product_category, order_priority):
    # Implement your dynamic cost calculation logic here
    # You can use if-else or other logic to determine the cost based on factors
    return dynamic_cost

dynamic_shipping_cost_udf = udf(calculate_dynamic_shipping_cost, DoubleType())

# Create a new column for dynamic shipping cost
ecommerce_data = ecommerce_data.withColumn("Dynamic_Shipping_Cost",
    dynamic_shipping_cost_udf(col("Product_Category"), col("Order_Priority"))
)

# Analyze the impact of dynamic shipping costs on profitability and satisfaction
# You can compare this with the previous shipping cost and analyze the impact

Here are PySpark transformations for the additional problem statements:

**5. Gender-Based Product Preferences:**

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
import pyspark.sql.functions as F

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("EcommerceAnalysis").getOrCreate()

# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'ecommerce_data'
# Group by 'Gender' and 'Product_Category' to identify top product preferences by gender
gender_product_preferences = ecommerce_data.groupBy("Gender", "Product_Category").count()

# Use Window functions to rank products within each gender group
window_spec = Window.partitionBy("Gender").orderBy(col("count").desc())
gender_product_preferences = gender_product_preferences.withColumn("Rank", F.row_number().over(window_spec))
top_product_preferences = gender_product_preferences.filter(col("Rank") <= 3)

# Perform a statistical test to determine significant differences in preferences
# You can use statistical tests like Chi-square or ANOVA to assess the differences.

# Provide recommendations for targeted marketing strategies
# Analyze the top product preferences for each gender and create marketing strategies accordingly.
```

**6. Device-Specific Sales Forecasting:**

```python
# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'ecommerce_data'
# Implement a time-series transformation to forecast sales for each product category
# Use Spark MLlib or other time series forecasting libraries for this task.

# Analyze the accuracy of forecasts for web and mobile devices
# Compare the forecasts for each device and highlight device-specific trends.
# You can use evaluation metrics like RMSE or MAE for accuracy assessment.
```

**7. Customer Engagement Score:**

```python
# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'ecommerce_data'
# Devise a formula to calculate a customer engagement score
# The formula may include factors like the frequency of logins, order priorities, and total sales.

# Create a new column for customer engagement score
ecommerce_data = ecommerce_data.withColumn("Engagement_Score",
    (col("Login_Frequency") + col("Total_Sales") + col("Order_Priority_Score"))
)

# Segment customers into engagement tiers
ecommerce_data = ecommerce_data.withColumn("Engagement_Tier",
    when(col("Engagement_Score") > 100, "High")
    .when((col("Engagement_Score") >= 50) & (col("Engagement_Score") <= 100), "Medium")
    .otherwise("Low")
)

# Analyze the relationship between engagement level and profitability
# Consider factors like product preferences, loyalty, and sales based on engagement tier.
```

**8. Discount Sensitivity by Payment Method:**

```python
# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'ecommerce_data'
# Apply a transformation to categorize payment methods into high, medium, and low sensitivity groups
# Define your sensitivity criteria based on historical data.

# Analyze how discount rates impact sales for each group
# Group by payment method sensitivity and analyze the impact of different discount rates on sales.

# Recommend targeted discount strategies based on sensitivity analysis
# Consider offering higher discounts for low-sensitivity groups and optimizing discounts for high-sensitivity groups.
```

Remember to adapt and modify these transformations to fit your specific dataset, variable names, and the criteria used for these analyses. Additionally, you may need to use statistical libraries or forecasting libraries for tasks like statistical testing or time series forecasting as required.
