# Copilot Data Engineering Workshop Starter Code

Welcome to the Copilot Data Engineering Workshop! This repository provides you with a starter codebase to experiment with various data engineering tasks using Python. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3 (Python 3.6 or higher is recommended)
- `pip` (Python package manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the provided data engineering script:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/antoprince001/copilot-dataengineering-python/
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd copilot-dataengineering-python
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the ETL Script

Now that you have set up your environment, you can run the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) script to experiment with data engineering tasks. Modify the `etl.py` script as needed for your specific use case.

To run the ETL script, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 etl.py
```

Feel free to explore and experiment with the script to perform various data engineering tasks. You can use Copilot's code suggestions and autocompletion features to make your data engineering tasks more efficient and productive.

Happy data engineering with Copilot! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
